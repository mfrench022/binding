			<blockquote class="first"><p><em>“</em>The day was very hot and windy and there were scribbles of citrus blowing across the sky.<em>”</em></p>
			<p>— <a href="https://dokumen.pub/the-songlines-9781448113026.html" target="_blank">Bruce Chatwin</a>, 1987</p></blockquote>

				<p>Typography may have entered the stratosphere of a new age, but the internal dynamic that propels it remains the same, a fusion of language and the alphabet. There is a linguistic impulse whereby the qualities we generally "ascribe" to one or the other - alphabetic writing and language - cross over. The unassuming line from Bruce Chatwin, in which he sees the locks of cirrus cloud as a kind of wild writing on the sky, as if he put it there which in a sense he did, immediately conjures the thread connecting us to our physical environment via writing. Writing gives the impression of things. Conversely, things can give the impression of writing. This association between writing and things provides a crude basis from which to outline a reading/writing list of favourite "typographies".</p>
				<p>For me the collection is characterised less by any traditional attributes of "typography" and more by a desire to inflect the idea of typography with a wider sense of what it is to read and to write. And neither are they "my typographies" in the sense that I constructed them: in this case I've replaced the idea of a typography - the impression of writing - of my own making with the impression of a typographical relationship to those rather prosaic acts of reading and writing: a relationship based on a literacy no longer contained by the <em>literascripta</em>, the written text, and which, at times, extends beyond the written word altogether. A poetics of typography operates in the space between language and the alphabet and along the invisible networks that connect writing to the world. It is characterised by a sense of literacy that allows us to see cirrus clouds as "scribbles" of writing. Its typography emerges in moments of horror, as points of light in the televisual relay of a laser guided military assault, or in something as unexpectedly poignant, yet equally visceral, as the observation of Aleksei Leonov, the Russian astronaut, when he said: "I believe I never knew what the word 'round' meant until I saw Earth from space."</p>
				<p>The Shipping Forecast, prepared by the Met. Office and broadcast by the BBC, is one of my favourite typographies. It describes - i n a combination of code and windswept location - an outline of the British Isles by reporting the weather condition from sea area to sea area, in a clockwise direction around the coast.</p>
				<p>The voice and theme of this reassuringly familiar British institution - that of a "blessed plot... bound in with the triumphant sea" - carries the resonance of Gaunt's deathbed speech in <em>Richard II:</em></p>
				<div class="line"></div>
				<blockquote><p><em>“ </em>Small show'rs last long, but sudden storms are short; this royal throne of Kings... this scept'red isle... This precious stone set in the silvered sea... Whose rocky shores beat back the envious siege Of wat'ry Neptune... this Low Fair Isle one thousand falling slowly...<em>”</em></p></blockquote>

				<p>Some designers viewed the distortion of the alphabet as gross and immoral, tied to a destructive and inhumane industrial system. Writing in 1906, Edward Johnston revived the search for an essential, standard alphabet and warned against the “dangers” of exaggeration. Johnston, inspired by the nineteenth-century Arts and Crafts movement, looked back to the Renaissance and Middle Ages for pure, uncorrupted letterforms.</p>
				<p>Although reformers like Johnston remained romantically attached to history, they redefined the designer as an intellectual distanced from the commercial mainstream. The modern design reformer was a critic of society, striving to create objects and images that would challenge and revise dominant habits and practices.</p>
				<p>The avant-garde artists of the early twentieth century rejected historical forms but adopted the model of the critical outsider. Members of the De Stijl group in the Netherlands reduced the alphabet to perpendicular elements. At the Bauhaus, Herbert Bayer and Josef Albers constructed letters from basic geometric forms—the circle, square, and triangle—which they viewed as elements of a universal language of vision.</p>
				<p>Such experiments approached the alphabet as a system of abstract relationships. Like the popular printers of the nineteenth century, avantgarde designers rejected the quest for essential letters grounded in the human hand and body, but they offered austere, theoretical alternatives in place of the solicitous novelty of mainstream advertising. Assembled like machines from modular components, these experimental designs emulated factory production.</p>
				<p>Yet most were produced by hand rather than as mechanical typefaces (although many are now available digitally). Futura, completed by Paul Renner in 1927, embodied the obsessions of the avant garde in a multipurpose, commercially available typeface. Although Renner disdained the active movement of calligraphy in favor of forms that are “calming” and abstract, he tempered the geometry of Futura with subtle variations in stroke, curve, and proportion. Renner designed Futura in numerous weights, viewing his type family as a painterly tool for constructing a page in shades of gray.</p>

				<p>Responding in 1967 to the rise of electronic communication, the Dutch designer Wim Crouwel published designs for a “new alphabet” constructed from straight lines. Rejecting centuries of typographic convention, he designed his letters for optimal display on a video screen (CRT), where curves and angles are rendered with horizontal scan lines. In a brochure promoting his new alphabet, subtitled “An Introduction  for a Programmed Typography,” he proposed a design methodology in which decisions are rule-based and systematic.</p>
				<p>In the mid-1980s, personal computers and low-resolution printers put the tools of typography in the hands of a broader public. In 1985 Zuzana Licko began designing typefaces that exploited the rough grain of early desktop systems. While other digital fonts imposed the coarse grid of screen displays and dot-matrix printers onto traditional typographic forms, Licko embraced the language of digital equipment. She and her husband, Rudy VanderLans, cofounders of Emigre Fonts and Emigre magazine, called themselves the “new primitives,” pioneers of a technological dawn.</p>
				<p>By the early 1990s, with the introduction of high-resolution laser printers and outline font technologies such as PostScript, type designers were less constrained by low-resolution outputs. While various signage systems and digital output devices still rely on bitmap fonts today, it is the fascination with programmed, geometric structures that has enabled bitmap forms to continue evolving as a visual ethos in print and digital media.</p>
